    <h1>Hello, </h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my personal site!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a 23 year-old Computer Science graduate looking to start my career
      doing something I am passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a reader, programmer, disc-golfer, hiker, biker, gamer, and overall
      cool guy. I enjoy using modern web technologies to make the user and
      developer's experience more fun and enjoyable. A bit of a mechanical
      keyboard enthusiast, and I won best-sense of humor in highschool and I'm
      still riding that wave.
    </p>
    <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>
      First and foremost, this website! It is written using{" "}
      <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a> to try something new. It
      is still a bit of a work-in-progress, but I am hoping to use this site to
      showcase my work and anything interesting about my life. Check back for
      updates!
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm Reading</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm enjoying J.R.R Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some recent reads of note include Frank Herbert's classic <i>Dune</i>, Dan
      Simmons' <i>Hyperion</i>, and Blake Crouch's page-turner <i>Recursion</i>{" "}
      (I'm on a bit of a Sci-Fi kick). I'm also counting down the days until
      book 4 of <i>The Stormlight Archive</i> by Brandon Sanderson.
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>
    <p>
      I have just started to get active on{" "}
      <a href="https://letterboxd.com/bailmom/">Letterboxd</a>, and my lists are
      nowhere near complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      TV show-wise, I'm a bit of a sucker for cartoons and <i>Breaking Bad</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm Playing</h2>
    <p>
      An unholy number of hours of <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </i> has
      been catalogued on my Switch recently.
